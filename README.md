### Intro
This project came from an obtuse interview question.  After failing the initial 1 hour test, I worked through the "sort-then-walk" solutions in JS and Python about another 1.5-2 hours.

A better solution, using a binary search exists however, which is much faster than my attempt.

Although obfuscated by language about leagues with 10^5 matches and football games with scores up to 10^9, the question was fundamentally:

Given two arrays of integers, return an array containing the counts of members of inputA with values lower than or equal to each member of inputB, retaining the order of inputB.

```
2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= input[i] <= 10^9 where 0 <= i < n
```
eg:
```js
counts([1,2,3], [2,4]) 
>>>
[2,3] 
// because:
// inputB[0] = 2, which is >= two members of inputA, 
// inputB[1] = 4, which is >= 3 members of inputA]
```

#### Performance
A summary:
- Node does respectably, excellent given how easy it is to use.
- Python is admirably fast with small data sets, but starts to struggle at the larger input sizes.
- Rust is a compiled language, designed for speed, so dominates.  For a low level language, it is very easy to work with, with an excellent and extremely helpful compiler.
> Obviously, execution speeds are hardware dependant.  
> Trying to optimise execution time in Node, beyond choosing a better algorithm, is largely [an exercise in futility](https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/2310b00d6eebb3f752f4ca803f1423d1).  Execution times can vary widely following apparently unrelated changes in code which appear to modify how the v8 JIT decides to compile the code.

> There's a good argument that we should not be mutating the inputs in any of these solutions, but instead creating local copies of the sorted arrays in each case.  There original question made no specification here, so as long as we're consistent, sorting the original array is deemed acceptable as the point here is to compare solutions.

> 23/03/22 : There must be an error in the binary search implementations in python and rust.  I currently have COVID, so have probably missed something obvious.

#### Solutions
Performance became an interesting part of this problem and, as I had already built simple solutions in JavaScript and Python, this seemed like a good opportunity to engage with my first statically typed language.  So, there are implementations of each potential solution in:
- [JS/Node](https://github.com/DBBrowne/obtuse-code-challenge-fuzzy-binary-search/blob/main/JavaScript_Solutions/nearestBinSearch.js)
- [Python](https://github.com/DBBrowne/obtuse-code-challenge-fuzzy-binary-search/blob/main/Python_Solutions/nearest_binary_search.py)
- [Rust](https://github.com/DBBrowne/obtuse-code-challenge-fuzzy-binary-search)

There are more workings and variations on the [JS and Python implementations](https://github.com/DBBrowne/code-challenges-public/blob/main/other/fuzzybinarysearch/) in my general code-challenges repo.

This was one of the first coding challenges I saw which required a bit of comp-sci knowledge, so I failed to see that this was a binary search problem.  Additionally, the input element value space (0 <= input[i] <= 1e9) being much larger than the input length space (2< i <=1e5) made a hashmap-style count solution almost as slow as the naive approach, and helped me fail to realise that there was a Binary Search solution.

Many thanks to @coolaj86 ([Github](https://github.com/coolaj86) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coolaj86) for his help, advice, and friendly competition.

And walking me through a better solution here:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLrCXtbmG4Q  

AJ's binary search then walk approach is demonstrated in [nearestBinSearch.js :: ajCount](https://github.com/DBBrowne/obtuse-code-challenge-fuzzy-binary-search/blob/main/JavaScript_Solutions/nearestBinSearch.js), and is only beaten by the later discovery of a way to use binary search to discover the upper bound of matching values.


The simple, naive implementations is:
```
  for each element in teamB, count members of teamA with value < element
```
|Rust|JavaScript|
|:---|:---|
|<pre>fn counts(team_a: Vec<u32>, team_b:Vec<u32>)->Vec<u32>{<br>  let mut output : Vec<u32> = Vec::with_capacity(team_b.len());<br>  for b in team_b {<br>    let mut counter = 0;<br>    for a in &team_a {<br>      if a<=&b {<br>        counter = counter + 1<br>      }<br>    };<br>    output.push(counter);<br>  };<br>  output<br>}</pre>|<pre>function counts(teamA, teamB){<br>  return teamB.map(scoreB=>{<br>    return (<br>      teamA.filter(scoreA=>{<br>        return scoreA <= scoreB<br>      }).length<br>    )<br>  })<br>}</pre>|

This solution has O(N^2) scaling however. As we move above input lengths of 10_000, this becomes completely unmanageable.

I didn't realise that this was a binary-search problem, or that binary-search would be fast enough to avoid the need to sort both arrays, so sought to reduce the scaling in other ways.
Sorting the inputs, then walking through them offered the opportunity to reduce complexity to O(2NlogN + 2N) = O(NlogN).  A great improvement,  but still much slower than a binary search.

In more detail:
- Copy `inputB` (so we can sort but still retain order)
- For each element `j` of sortedB, walk through A until the value of `A[i]` exceeds `B[j]`.  
- The index of our walker will be the count of A with lower values than our target B, so record this in a HashMap `[B[j]:i]`.
- Continue walking until end of A or value of `A` exceeds `max(B)`
- Replace each value in our un-sorted inputB with the relevant value from the hashmap.
- Return the modified `inputB`

This isn't terrible time-wise, more than fast enough to pass the timeout limit on the test, but certainly not as fast as a fully-correct implementation.

The "Correct" solution is to:
- sort inputA
- search A for each element of inputB with a binary search, then to the end of any matching groups
>(ie returns index of nearest match to each element of inputB (walking right to find max index = max count of lower scores).
- Pre-allocating the output array offers a significant speed up at larger input sizes.

After further research, a method to continue using the binary search method to find the upper bound of matching elements exists, ofeirng the fastest solution to this problem:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/41956372/15995918

```js
function binarySearch(array, pred) {
  let left = -1
  let right = array.length
  while ((1 + left) < right) {
    // Bitwise version of Math.floor((hi-lo) / 2)
    const mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1)
    if (pred(array[mid])) {
      right = mid
    } else {
      left = mid
    }
  }
  return right
}
function upperBound(array, target) {
  return binarySearch(array, j => target < j)
}
function binarySearchBounds(inputs, refs){
  inputs.sort(compareAscending)

  return refs.map(function(ref){
    return upperBound(inputs, ref)
  })
}
```

### Usage
#### Rust
Install Rust if necessary. Webi offers the easiest, most reliable way to do this: https://webinstall.dev/rustlang/

```console
curl -sS https://webinstall.dev/rustlang | bash
```

Build and run the app:
```console
cargo build --release
./target/release/obtuse_interview_scores
>>>
<Assertions>      // will panic if failing
<Execution times> // for different functions and input scales, from 10k to 10m.
```
#### JavaScript
```console
node ./JavaScript_Solutions/nearestBinSearch.js
```

#### Python
```console
python3 ./Python_Solutions/nearest_binary_search.py
```

### Running Tests

This whole app is a test!

### Known Issues

- Currently translations of the binary sort approaches into Rust and Python clearly have errors, as their execution time is terrible.
